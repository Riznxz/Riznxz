## Hey, I’m Rizwana 👋
Rizwana Nesrin | Aspiring AI/DS Engineer | Lifelong Learner

🎓 B.Tech Artificial Intelligence & Data Science  | 🤖 Future AI/ML Engineer | 🌍 Passionate about Data, AI & Automation  

I’m an AI & Data Science enthusiast who learns by **building, experimenting, and sharing**.  
I love turning raw ideas into working systems — whether it’s a machine learning model, an AI-powered tool, or a clean visualization that makes data come alive.  

💡 For me, **AI is not just technology — it’s the future I want to help build.**
